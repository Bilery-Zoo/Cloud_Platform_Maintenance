About Config File


    There is only one config file including authentication info(access key / secret key) of AWS and AlibabaCloud
    accounts in current version.

        /config/auth.py

    As accounts info of cloud platforms changing, you can correct them freely and easily by doing generally
    INSERT, DELETE and MODIFY actions.
    Variables below are authentication info in current version. You can easily recognize each info
    by its three-part-namespace.

        AlibabaCloud_Access_Key
            -> AlibabaCloud Environment Access key & Secret key
        AWS_Access_Key
            -> AWS Environment Access key & Secret key

    For example, when you want to authenticate access to AWS environment account,
    just please pass in the variable of `AWS_Access_Key`. These authentication info variables are imported into
    every main call files, so you can read a line of head code in each of them like:

        from CloudPlatform_WhitelistIP_Switcher.config.auth import AlibabaCloud_Access_Key

About Argument Variable


    When you are going to execute a call file listed upper, you may need to respecify the argument variables. Such as
    info of access authentication to cloud platform account, new WhitelistIP to append and old WhitelistIP to remove.
    Each call file has a head info area for you to set values of these variables. For example,
    in `aws_new_whitelistip_append.py`, the head info area contains argument variables like this

        key = AWS_Access_Key
        new_whitelistip = "127.0.0.1"
        old_whitelistip = "127.0.0.0"

    If you want to append a new whitelistIP of "172.172.172.172" into AWS environment, and the old whitelistIP
    is "127.127.127.127", just correct its values like below.

        key = AWS_Access_Key
        new_whitelistip = "172.172.172.172"
        old_whitelistip = "127.127.127.127"
